# bikeshare-ride-duration-prediction-service

[Capital Bikeshare](https://capitalbikeshare.com/) is a bikeshare service operating in Washington, D.C., with 5,000 bikes and 600+ stations.
The company provides a mobile app for users to rent bikes and manage their rides.
The app has a map screen on which a user can search for the station nearest to their destination, however no estimated trip time is provided.
Capital Bikeshare would like to build a ride duration prediction service that will enable them to add an estimated trip time feature to the app.
